# Food Delivery Data Analysis

##  Project Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project for FoodHub (New York food aggregator company) examining 1,898 food delivery orders from the `foodhub_order.csv` dataset to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, and operational efficiency. The goal is to assist the company in making data-driven decisions to improve service quality, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction through analysis of cuisine popularity, delivery time optimization, revenue patterns, and actionable business recommendations.

##  Key Objectives

- Understand popular cuisine types and their relationship with cost, ratings, and preparation time
- Analyze patterns in order timings across different days of the week (weekend vs weekday)
- Identify top-performing restaurants based on order volume and customer ratings
- Estimate the revenue generated by the platform based on tiered commission structure (25% on orders >$20, 15% on orders >$5)
- Analyze customer segmentation and loyalty patterns for retention strategies
- Evaluate operational efficiency through delivery time and preparation time analysis
- Provide data-driven business recommendations backed by statistical analysis and visualizations

    (df['cost_of_the_order'] > 5)
]
choices = [
    df['cost_of_the_order'] * 0.25,
    df['cost_of_the_order'] * 0.15
]
df['revenue'] = np.select(conditions, choices, default=0)
total_revenue = df['revenue'].sum()  # $6,166.30
```

```python
# Top 3 most frequent customers for loyalty program
top_customers = df['customer_id'].value_counts().head(3)

```

**Operational Time Analysis:**
```python
# Total delivery time calculation
df['total_time'] = df['food_preparation_time'] + df['delivery_time']
long_orders = df[df['total_time'] > 60].shape[0]
percentage_long_orders = (long_orders / df.shape[0]) * 100  # 10.54%
