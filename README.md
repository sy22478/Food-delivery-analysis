# 🍽️ Food Delivery Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive data analysis project for FoodHub (New York food aggregator company) examining 1,898 food delivery orders from the `foodhub_order.csv` dataset to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, and operational efficiency. The goal is to assist the company in making data-driven decisions to improve service quality, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction through analysis of cuisine popularity, delivery time optimization, revenue patterns, and actionable business recommendations.

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Understand popular cuisine types and their relationship with cost, ratings, and preparation time
- Analyze patterns in order timings across different days of the week (weekend vs weekday)
- Identify top-performing restaurants based on order volume and customer ratings
- Estimate the revenue generated by the platform based on tiered commission structure (25% on orders >$20, 15% on orders >$5)
- Analyze customer segmentation and loyalty patterns for retention strategies
- Evaluate operational efficiency through delivery time and preparation time analysis
- Provide data-driven business recommendations backed by statistical analysis and visualizations

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- Cuisine popularity distribution and price vs rating correlation
- Delivery time vs order time-of-day patterns (peak hours vs off-peak)
- Restaurant performance metrics: average rating, order counts, revenue estimates
- Commission-based revenue calculation using tiered structure
- Customer ordering behavior and retention indicators

## 📈 Visualizations
- Histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots for numerical insights
- Bar charts for categorical distributions (cusine type, restaurant, day of week)
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis
